"""	How I made this django-docker-start:

	My django project is already done. I have just cloned from https://github.com/grbeno/Django-start.git
		- Create new repo for this project and changing the remote ($ git remote set-url origin ...)
	Create Dockerfile
		- pipenv -> pipfile, pipfile.lock || requirements.txt
	Create docker-compose.yml
		- this is for more container. In our case for a django app (services:web:) and a postgres database (services:db:).	"""

HOW TO USE:

1. Install docker if it is not installed yet!

2. Download .zip from github to your project folder -> https://github.com/grbeno/Django-docker-start.git

3. $ cd <your_project_folder>

4. $ docker-compose build

5. $ docker-compose up -d

6. Call localhost in your browser to test!

* You should generate new secret-key with: $ docker-compose exec web python -c 'import secrets;print(secrets.token_urlsafe(38))'
* you should then create <.env> file in the main folder, export new secret-key, then call it as <web:environment:> in your <.yml> file with ${DJANGO_SECRET_KEY}!
